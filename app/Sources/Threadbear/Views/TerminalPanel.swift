/// The Terminal panel (⌘J, View > Show Terminal): a real terminal in the
/// dock, as VS Code and T3 Code have under their editor. SwiftTerm draws it
/// and runs your login shell in a pty, so colours, the cursor keys and
/// full-screen programs (vim, htop, claude) work as in Terminal.
///
/// Each thread has a shell of its own, started in the thread's folder (its
/// worktree when it has one) and kept running while you look at other
/// threads, so switching back finds it as you left it. A thread on another
/// Mac or the cloud gets a shell on this Mac in your home folder, with a
/// line saying so, as its folder isn't here. With no thread open it's a
/// shell in your home folder too.
///
/// A shell only starts when you ask for one: ⌘J, or clicking the empty
/// panel. Clicking through threads with the panel open, or launching with
/// it left open, starts nothing, as each login shell reads your whole
/// profile. A thread's shell stops when the thread is archived or deleted
/// (a dev server left running there would otherwise keep going in a
/// worktree the next thread gets), and every shell stops when the app quits.
