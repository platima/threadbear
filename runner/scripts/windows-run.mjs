// Keeps the runner up on Windows: what launchd's KeepAlive does on a Mac.
// The logon task (install-windows.mjs) runs this; it runs the runner from
// the checkout it sits in, and starts it again after it exits, whether it
// crashed or restarted itself (runner.restart exits 0 and expects a
// supervisor). Ending the task ends this, the runner and the CLIs, as Task
// Scheduler runs a task's processes in one job.
//
// A runner that keeps failing is tried again after longer and longer waits (5 s,
// 10 s, 20 s, up to 5 minutes), and a runner that ran for a minute starts the
// waits again. A runner that finds another one already using the data folder
// ends this supervisor instead, with exit code 0 so Task Scheduler doesn't
// start it again: whoever is running that one (a terminal, say) is in charge.
//
// A runner run this way is a runner from source: no releases, no follow main,
// no handover (docs/windows-port-plan.md). Update it with `git pull`.
