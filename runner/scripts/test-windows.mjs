// Runs the runner's unit tests on Windows in two groups: the files that
// should pass (a failure fails the run) and the ones in
// test/windows-known-failing.txt (a report, so the list can shrink as the
// port goes). Usage, from runner/:
//
//   node scripts/test-windows.mjs            the files that should pass
//   node scripts/test-windows.mjs --known    the known-failing files, as a report
//   node scripts/test-windows.mjs a.test.ts  just those files
//
// Each test gets 30 seconds (60 on CI), not the package's five minutes, so a
// test waiting on something Windows can't give fails fairly quickly. The
// limit has to leave room for load: node runs several files at once, and a
// test that starts runners or reads process start times through PowerShell
// takes 3 s on a quiet machine and over 40 s when every core is busy. At
// 15 s, CI failed main.test.ts on the clock alone (6 Nov). The limit can be
// set with THREADBEAR_TEST_TIMEOUT_MS.
